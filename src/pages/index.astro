      <p>
        <strong>151 Card House</strong> is a reference archive dedicated to Pokémon trading cards
        released prior to the year 2000. The goal of this site is accuracy, completeness,
        and historical preservation — not hype.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project focuses on early Pokémon card history, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Japanese-exclusive sets and vending series</li>
        <li>English and Japanese pre-WotC and WotC-era cards</li>
        <li>Card variants, alternate backs, and print differences</li>
        <li>Set structure and historical context</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Over time, this archive will expand to include individual set pages,
        card-level entries, images, and sourcing notes.
      </p>
